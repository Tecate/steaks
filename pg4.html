						<p>Every year, strike that- on the daily, we hear constantly how e-comm will take a way business from bricks and mortar.</p>
						<p>Todays generation of commercial real estate properties are continually looking to attract bigger and better anchor retailers and the newest and brightest brands from around the world to ensure they stay relevant in retail.</p>
						<p>Kudos to the mall giant that gets it's not just about attracting those big retailers- although this altogether helps drive traffic but it's when the real estate property stops thinking like a realtor and starts behaving like a retailer.</p>
						<p>This year, for anyone who shops at any shopping centre within Canada, I have to sincerely take my faux fur hat off to Yorkdale Shopping Centre for building their mall like a fantastic retail brand.</p>
						<p>They started years ago with a sense of purpose- they were a fashion mall- and they jumped in with stilettos on to ensure this was going to be made loud and clear to those visiting Yorkdale. They had imagery posted everywhere earlier this year of prolific style icons shot by none other than Brian Adams. In the fall they hired Victor Demarchelier to shoot the What's Next campaign.  The end result was covet-worthy ensembles for any fashion lover.    </p>
						<p>They took a look at their tenants not only as profitable rent payers but as strategic partners, ensuring that in meaningful ways they integrated those brands into online content that would resonate with their consumers.  They profiled Canadian influencers and received testimonials on why they loved to visit Yorkdale.  They worked hard at their game plan and continually ensured that the mall played the entertainer by hosting a series of interesting events, and played host to temporary pop up retailers to really house the next up and coming trends within Canada.</p>
						<p>Gone are the days where it's enough to dress the shopping center up with holiday d&eacute;cor and a great Santa village to attract shoppers, this alone just doesn't do it anymore. What does do it- who knew...they got a HOT fashion Santa! And swoon we did!   </p>
						<p>This put a smile on my face for several reasons; it takes a lot for someone who's been in retail for 20 years to see something new and notable.  This took me by complete surprise.  This made total sense, this was funny, sexy and well- fashionable.</p>
						<p>People around the world talked about Fashion Santa, there were interviews, celebrity pics, and the social media world new he was only at Yorkdale Shopping Mall.  Type Fashion Santa into Google and you'll see over 250 million results come up. A huge, memorable win, and a fantastic integration of Yorkdale's canny ability to marry social content with the in store experience.</p>
						<p>Yorkdale continually raises the bar on every front, they understand how to build a brand, leverage strategic partners and provide a retail experience that delivers on surprise and delight moments.</p>
						<p>Congratulations Yorkdale you did an outstanding job in 2015!   </p>
						<p>Happy Shopping!<br>Anna</p>

				<p>Over the last few years as fast fashion has carved out their unequivocal success in the retail landscape, and choices from just about everything of the moment are attainable at any price range, my mind has switched to another way to spend my disposable dollars, especially at Christmas. </p>
        <p>Perhaps it's my years in the business creating mass product lines off shore, or maybe its' just that with age brings wisdom that we all have the very ability to connect commerce to humanity as said beautifully by Fashion designer Waris Ahluwalia.</p>
        <p>And this brings me to what has come to fruition in the marketplace. With great enthusiasm, I have been witnessing first hand businesses launching products that revolve around craftsmanship, handmade, artisan pieces becoming readily available.  Affordable, accessible, socially conscious product from gourmet food to fine jewelry have made their way not just through the launch of Etsy back in 2005, but now through the meticulous scrutiny and selection process of style savants such as Alexandra Weston for Holts H Project.</p>
        <p>H Project launched in 2013 as a store in store boutique, and through the vision and guidance of Alexandra and her team beautiful products are selected and displayed in store, each with their own special raison d'&ecirc;tre. Selected based on their story, small batch ingredients, artisan history or interesting materials. In addition by leveraging the business vision of Holt Renfrew, exclusive collaborations lead by some notable North American designers in limited edition quantities were made whereby the total proceeds go to the designers charity of choice, how heartwarming is that! </p>
        <p>This has paved the way for a retailing pioneer like Holt Renfrew to elevate the advancement of the "artisan movement" to a whole other scale.  H Project has visited out of the way places around the world to respectfully source one of a kind objects while helping these small businesses and communities grow and be successful in their own right. They have also successfully launched several initiatives whereby purchases give back to the communities of these particular artisans. Most notable campaigns have included Uncrate Africa and Uncrate India. </p>
        <p>In 2014 ecommerce gave way to the birth of some fantastic stylista's with an eye on both socially conscious products and intricate artisan pieces.</p>

        <p><b><a href="http://www.brika.com">BRIKA</a></b>- was born from the idea of modern day craftsmanship.  Partners Jennifer Koss & Kena Paranjape has fostered a kindred spirit in their vision of bringing beautiful products into the everyday.  By hand selecting makers from across North America, their stunning website allows you to shop for arts & prints, house & home, children and jewelry all in one shop.  If you frequent Yorkdale Shopping center I highly encourage you visit their POP UP shop where their wares are beautifully laid out and is as easy to find as shopping on their website. Once you've selected your beautiful gift you are free to select wrappings at the wrap station and wrap it up complimentary! Want to try your hand at your own personal craft, these savvy women have incorporated partnerships with Makeful, the new TV show that focuses on celebrating the maker community and the creation of one of a kind pieces.  They have also partnered with several other local businesses to hold a variety of different and cool DIY classes inside their shop. <br><br> You will undoubtedly enjoy the experience of being able to purchase one of a kind gifts for yourself or others and try you're hand at a chic DIY.</p>

        <p><b><a href="http://www.unikati.ca">UNIKATI</a></b>- another pair of passionate women, Dina and Leila began travelling the world and discovering far off places, visiting cooperatives, artisan groups and non government organization's to learn their stories, discover their long history of tradition in their work and bringing these much loved pieces to Canada for us to enjoy.  Each piece has a story and helps these communities first hand with your purchase.  I dare you not to shed a tear when you know that a purchase you make has helped empower these makers first hand.  </p>
        <p>While all these businesses have a common goal with bringing artisan pieces to Canadians their individual approach to how they communicate the experience to us and what they select making it so exciting to follow and shop at each establishment.</p>
        <p>This season, do something easy- visit their stores or website and buy some very original product that will leave a lasting impression with the makers and those you are gifting too. Why not be part of the artisan movement yourself, you'll feel great about how your spending your holiday dollars.</p>
        Happy Shopping!<br><br>
        Anna
